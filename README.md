## Project Insights

-The overall attrition rate is 20.6%, mostly in the 26–35 age group.

-Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles show the highest attrition.

-Employees with lower salaries (₹0–5K) and less than 3 years at the company are more likely to leave.

-Job satisfaction and work experience strongly influence retention.

-The Decision Tree model gave the best prediction accuracy for attrition.

## Conclusion

The HR Analytics Dashboard helps the organization understand and reduce employee attrition by providing clear insights into who is leaving and why.
Using data-driven strategies, the company can improve retention, boost performance, and make smarter HR decisions.
